Welcome to the server hosters package of HorizonMW h2m-mod.

To setup your server simply place server_default.bat en server_default.cfg into the Modern Warfare Remastered.

After you have added the files to the folder you can edit the server_default.cfg file. It should speak for itself.

Inside the user_scripts/mp folder you'll be able to find 3 scripts which you can add to your Modern Warfare Remastered/user_scripts/mp folder:
1. bots.gsc, this will spawn bots in your server.
2. h2m_kick_max_rank.gsc, this will kick all lvl 1000 players (Mostly unlockall).
3. welcome.gsc , this will display a nice welcome message to players joining your server.
